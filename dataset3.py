You: Code a Acronym interpreter based on an ai buiding acronym formula:
BATMAN_AI:
The BATMAN_AI acronym interpreter would be designed to identify acronyms and their meanings using artificial intelligence. It would use a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze the text for acronyms and their respective meanings, and then create a formula to accurately interpret them. The interpreter would also be able to suggest alternate meanings for acronyms, and provide additional context when necessary.

BATMAN_AI:
The BATMAN_AI acronym interpreter is a tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret acronyms. It works by taking a given acronym and using a formula to break it down into its component parts. The components are then used to generate a definition for the acronym. This tool can be used to quickly and accurately interpret acronyms, making it an invaluable resource for those who need to understand technical terms quickly.
